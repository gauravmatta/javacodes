/*
 * Two strings are given, word and substr. Some of the characters in word are a question mark (?).
 * ﻿Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by replacing '?' ﻿characters such
 * that substr appears at least once. If it is not possible to do so,﻿return "-1".
 * Note:
 * A substring is a coptiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, "bcd" is a 
 * substring of "abcde" but "ac" is not.
 * For two strings a and 𝑏 ﻿of the same length, 𝑎 ﻿is lexicographically smaller than 𝑏 if ai<b𝑖 for some
 * 0<|𝑎|𝑎𝑗=𝑏𝑗 
 * word = 𝑎𝑠?𝑏?𝑒?𝑔𝑓 
 * substr = 𝑑𝑏𝑘.
 * Replace 3𝑟𝑑 and 5𝑡ℎ dbk 0≤𝑗.
 * Example word = 𝑎𝑠?𝑏?𝑒?𝑔𝑓 substr =𝑑𝑏𝑘.Replace the 3𝑟𝑑 and 5𝑡ℎ characters with '𝑑' ﻿and '𝑘' 𝑡𝑜 
 * get "asdbke?𝑔𝑓" ﻿which has substr ="𝑑𝑏𝑘" 𝑎𝑠 𝑎 substring. Replace the remaining '?' with '𝑎'.
 * The final string 𝑖𝑠 "asdbkeagf".The answer 𝑖𝑠 ﻿"asdbkeagf", without quotes.
