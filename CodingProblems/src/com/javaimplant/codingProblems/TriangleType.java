/*
 * In the assembly line, the factory assembles three parts ' a ' ' b ' ' c ' of a triangle toy. A
 * valid toy is one where the three sides can connect at their endpoints.
 * There are two forms of valid triangles to identify.
 * If 2 parts are of equal length, the form is 'Isosceles'
 * If all 3 parts are of equal length, the form is 'Equilateral'
 * If a toy is not valid or is not one of those 2 forms, it is 'None of these'.
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * triangleToy=['2 2 1;'3 3 3','3 4 5','1 1 3']
 * The first triangle is valid and has 2 equal parts, so the form is 'Isosceles'
 * The second is valid and has 3 equal parts, so the form is 'Equilateral'
 * The third is valid but not one of the two specific forms.
 * The fourth is not valid.
 * The result is ["Isosceles", "Equilateral", "None of these", "None of these"]
